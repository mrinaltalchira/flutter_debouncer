/// the widget — you never need to manually call [Debouncer.dispose].

/// ## Basic usage
/// ```dart
/// class _SearchBarState extends State<SearchBar> with DebouncerMixin {
///   void _onChanged(String query) {
///     debounce(() => _search(query));
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Custom delay
/// ```dart
/// @override
/// Duration get debounceDuration => const Duration(milliseconds: 500);
/// ```
///
/// ## Custom strategy
/// ```dart
/// @override
/// DebouncerStrategy get debouncerStrategy => const LeadingEdgeStrategy();
/// ```
